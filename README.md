# Deep-Learning-Based-Identification-of-3D-objects-and-grasping
Key highlights of the project include:
ðŸ”¸ Leveraging pre-trained DL network (Generative Grasping Convolutional Neural Network) to accurately identify objects and determine the optimal grasp location.
ðŸ”¸ Creating a dataset of custom 3D objects.
ðŸ”¸ Utilizing the results from the DL algorithm to successfully grasp objects.
ðŸ”¸ Employing Robot Studio as a simulation tool to perform grasping.

Please see the GGCNN repository for the Deep Learning code and setup. Use Jacquard dataset to get best results.
