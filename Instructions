To implement this:
Visit the GGCNN repository and implement the code to evaluate the pre trained model on Jacquard dataset. Run simulations to visualize the model.
Replicate the Jacquard dataset by designing a white background.
Kinect.txt has a general code to click pictures in Matlab using kinect camera. 
Test the camera and start clicking pictures of custom data.
Save the custom data and store it in the Jacquard format so that it is recognizable by the algorithm.
Use the pixel coordinates obtained from the algorithm and convert it into real world coordinates.
Connect the linux system to a window system by establishing a socket communication.
Use the coordinates to grasp the object in simulation in Robot studio.
